# scheduler
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This scheduling algorithm tries to create a schedule based on preferences using maximum flow theory. The main purpose of the algorithm will be to fairly distribute a set of people over a set of tasks for n shifts. It tries to get rid of biases by using random choices and orderings, and making it so 1 person can not get more unlucky than another. </p>

<h2> Requirements </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Amount of people equals amount of tasks </li>
    <li> People can only perform 1 task per shift </li>
</ul>
